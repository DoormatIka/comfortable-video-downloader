## Usage
`links.txt` is where you put Soundcloud, YouTube, whatever links.

The videos will be installed inside the `"completed/NA"` folder. Playlists will be installed inside a `"completed/{playlist name}"` folder.
## Info
This is a rewrite of Ctaehko's ChatGPT code of a Youtube Downloader.

This was done for free, sadly.
